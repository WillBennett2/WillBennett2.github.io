									<h1>Super Clone Ball</h1>
									<p>This post covers a Game Engine Programming course project made in Unity with C#.</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									This game is inspired by Super Monkey Ball which I played a lot in my childhood. It features platforming mechanics often found in the Super Monkey Ball series. The main feature of the game
									is the movement itself. I wanted to replicate this mechanic within this game, it was achieved through the use of the camera to give an illusion that the player is tilting the platform.
									Additionally the player is able to select levels through a physical level select world. These gateways show the player their best times on the level as well as blocking them from entering
									levels yet to be unlocked.
								</p>

								<p>
									The main learning point in the creation of this game was camera trickery, as this was my first attempt into using the camera to affect the feeling of gameplay. The application of this mechanic
									was the main cause of most issues with this project, which was overcome through research of forums and Unity's documentation. It definitely made me more aware of the tools that game developers have
									and their potential effect on gameplay if used in the correct way. Additionally while reading through Unity's documentation, I found scriptable objects which are used in this game as a save system.
