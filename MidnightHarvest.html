								This project was part of the Group Game Development module. The assessment was to create a engine and a game within 6 weeks with a team of 
								game programmers and developers. The team I was apart of was made up of 10 members with 5 dev and 5 programmers. We initally set up parameters
								of what the engine would need taking expertese into account. We then decided on features that would be needed for the type of game we wanted to
								produce. We landed on a 2D bullet hell farming game. This sounds like a complex mashup of genres but it can be boiled down to a game where the player
								fights the crops they grow in a bullet hell fight. The player can buy seeds and plant in a day phase, this is then followed to the player trying to kill the plants that they grew in the night. These
								enemies will spawn in waves with each giving the player different amount of money to buy more coins. This would then lead to a boss fight after 5 nights. This module helps provide a great environment
								to work with other peers with different strengths and weaknesses and gave a great experience in how to function in this environment.

								In this project I used and gave feedback to the programmers on the engine tools they created, an example of this is a tilemap editor having layers
								and each layer being visable to make environment creation easier. I also created the inventory for the players to store the seeds they buy while 
								working with the team to make sure the shop item collisions work when buying the seeds. As the team lacked an artist for the assets I stepped up
								and created and sourced the art for the game. I created the UI as well as the enemies, while the tiles and player were sourced externally.
