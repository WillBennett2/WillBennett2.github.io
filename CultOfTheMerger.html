										<h1>Cult Of The Merger</h1>
										<p>This post covers a Mobile Dev course project made in Unity with C#.</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										The game is about managing a cult and sacrificing entities to a greater being through a portal. This has the player summoning minions which they can upgrade by combining two of the same
										minion. This upgrade will increase thier value for sacrificing, as well as its damage, and mana generation. Mana is how the player is able to summon their minions, while damage is used to
										defeat enemies that come into the cult based on how many minions you spawn. Once defeated they will drop gems which can be used to purchase upgrades.
									</p>

									<p>
										This project was part of my undergrad studies so along side the game, researching into techniques used in the mobile industry was vital. This oppurtunity allowed for growth in knowledge into
										the mobile industry. An example of this is API intergration such as logins and achichievements through Google Play Services, or applying retention mechanics to keep player's attention. To achieve the desired
										effects of the strategies it was important to properly research into their use cases and apply this to the design choices of the game.
									</p>

									<p>
										This project allowed the exploration of these mechanics and provided challenges which was outside of my comfort zone. These were overcome via researching how people faced these issues,
										and adapting thier approach to suit my needs. Another insight this project provide was being able to layout design choices and stick to them over a course of a year. This type of project
										management skill is valuable as it can be applied to later projects. An example of this is a correct prototyping procedures to test mechanics to see if they are suitable and fun for the game
										without spending too much time on the mechanic.
