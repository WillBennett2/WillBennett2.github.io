						<p>
							This project was made in Unity with C#, with the level generation being done using the tool I created in my previous  <a href="ExplorationIntoProceduralContentGeneration.html">post graduate studies</a>.
							The aim of this project was to create a game that focuses on the theoratical practices to increase player engagement, and applying that theory to using mechanics to increase player engagement. These mechanics
							were then applied to the roguelike genre due to its reliance on replayability and keeping the player's engagement.

								<h3>Card Placing</h3>

								<p>
									Half of the interactions in this game comes from the cards, placing cards can change which minions spawn on the board, give combat special effects, or apply permanent buffs.
									Downside of this is after a certain number of cards is placed, the boss will spawn. The player will have to balance defence and being prepared.
