										<h1>Midnight Harvest</h1>
										<p>This post covers a group project where an engine and a game had to be made in 6 weeks.</p>
									</header>

									<p>
										The gameplay has the player tending to a farm, but when it turns to night the crops come to life. In order to harvest their crops the player will have to kill them all in a bullet hell styled gameplay.
										Each day the player can buy more seeds to increase the difficulty of the night or spend the money gained on upgrades. On the 5th night the player must fight a carrot boss to be able to beat the game.
									</p>

									<p>
										This project was part of my undergrad studies, this module focused on pairing developers and programmers together to create an engine and a game with said engine in 6 weeks. My role was lead developer
										so I had to communicate joint ideas to the programming team so they could create the engine to allow for the game's creation. We also all took turns leading SCRUM meetings to gain vital experience in this role.
										<br>
										This project took a high amount of motivation and management to maintain good practices and communication for the 6 week period. While overall the project went well, there were key moments upon reflecting that
										could have been sorted with clear documentaion being regulated between members to keep expectations consistent. Although, the project was insightful into how two different skilled game departments may communicate in
										industry.
