										The game is about reaching the big boss called Bomber Geeza, to do so the player has to fight through 5 levels to reach him. While playing these levels the player will discover new
										bomb types to expand their arsenal. Standing in the way of the player is Bomber Geeza's men, which will try to gun down the player. They will have to out smart the enemies by using
										the bombs at the disposal and blowing past them to reach the final boss fight.

										This project was part of my undergrad studies, this module focused on pairing developers and programmers together to create a game within 3 weeks. This allowed us to expand our skills on
										time management as well as delegating tasks to reach deadlines as a team. Without correct communication this project would not have been able to be completed. Throughout issues occured which
										team members were unable to fix themselves. This lead to delegation of resources to help each other with issues while progressing our own tasks.
									</p>

									<p>
										This was my first experience of working as a team with random teammates, which allowed me to gain skills outside of my comfort zone. One of the key ones was project management. Due to some team members
										having less experience with the Unity Engine, the more experienced developres often helped them with Unity specific systems. This lead to delicate time management between two important tasks. This is often
										over looked when doing projects alone since you know your own strengths. As a team we often gave developers a mix of tasks they were comfortable with, this allowed for them to gain skills while making solid progress.
										The majority of each person's workload was within their skillset which allowed for constant progress and extra time for polishing the game at the end.
